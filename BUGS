BUGS
----
* The following bug is now mostly killed for Bashish, bashish now traps the WINCH 
  before the application is started. The delay waiting for the SIGWINCH is roughly 
  0.4s   on my AMD64 2800+

  Keyboard dysfunction bug with various editors (seen on emacs, joe and vim
  others will probably be affected too.)
  When using Gnome-terminal in Metacity with full screen maximization and
  switching the font so the aspect ratio of the terminal changes, the
  terminal informs the application by signalling a WINCH signal. 
  This unfortually happens at application startup, at the same time as the
  editor tries to set the keyboard to a editor-friendly state with an 'ioctl'.
  The 'ioctl' does furthermore not get set and keyboard movement keys and
  control keys will be echoed in the terminal instead of trapped by the
  editor.
  By looking at the 'strace' of joe I found that I can reset the terminal to
  the editor-friendly state by entering 'stty -opost -isig -icanon -echo </dev/pts/3' 
  (with the affected tty as stdin)
  
  This bug has plauged Bashish a long while, it has probably been unseen as
  no one has expected the programs to accept WINCH at startup.
  As long as the terminal is able to send WINCH this might affect
  applications, that means this bug could (and does) affect XTerm, aterm,
  wterm, rxvt-unicode, rxvt, gnome-terminal.
  Further discussion here (for 'joe'):

  I have not found this BUG on Solaris 10, might it be linux specific?
