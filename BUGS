KNOWN BUGS
----------
## $LAUNCHER PID isnt updated when running child shells and then
## exiting
kill -s WINCH $LAUNCHER_PID 2>/dev/null


* bashish --configure does not work yet, remove your ~/.bashish and install
  again if you would like to add another shell.

* ARGV is not used correctly in 'bashish' and 'bashishtheme' commands

* rxvt-beta in ubuntu x86-64 segfaults, discouraged in use with bashish

* rxvt-cvs has problems updating the font if using a pixmap background.
  This  bug needs further investigation and has thus not been
  reported to the Rxvt developers.

* Rxvt-cvs clears the screen each time a theme repaint occurs.
  This bug is reported to the Rxvt developers.

* Eterm versions below 0.9.3 have several color setting bugs. If possible
  do use the latest version.

* XTerm has resize problems under Sawfish(and others) Fullscreen mode.
  This has been reported to XTerm maintainer, the bug is currently
  present as of version 194.

* Suspending with un-theming and re-themeing when returning to the
  application is only supported on bash:
  * zsh complains about wrong FD:
    http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1413647&group_id=4068&atid=104068
  * pdksh suspends when trying to launch the command
  * ksh93 ignores if monitor mode is set or not
  perhaps I'm misunderstanding the "monitor" feature :) please point me to
  appropiate documentation if that's the case :)
  there is a workaround in Bashish so monitor mode will not be actived on
  non-bash shells.


Resolved / Workaround
---------------------
* Resolved. This bug was because the early code for supporting
  gnome-terminal would accidently add multiple profiles to the profile_list
  key in gconf, this is no longer the case since the profiles are named
  after the ttys.

  bashish might crash gnome-terminal upon starting a new tab, 
  discussion here: 
  http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167557

"Yet, since the fix is so simple, and (god knows why) somebody's tripped on this
problem before, I vote for the patch being applied." :)

* The following bug is now mostly killed for Bashish, bashish now traps the WINCH 
  before the application is started. The delay waiting for the SIGWINCH is roughly 
  0.4s   on my AMD64 2800+

  Keyboard dysfunction bug with various editors (seen on emacs, joe and vim
  others will probably be affected too.)
  When using Gnome-terminal in Metacity with full screen maximization and
  switching the font so the aspect ratio of the terminal changes, the
  terminal informs the application by signalling a WINCH signal. 
  This unfortually happens at application startup, at the same time as the
  editor tries to set the keyboard to a editor-friendly state with an 'ioctl'.
  The 'ioctl' does furthermore not get set and keyboard movement keys and
  control keys will be echoed in the terminal instead of trapped by the
  editor.
  By looking at the 'strace' of joe I found that I can reset the terminal to
  the editor-friendly state by entering 'stty -opost -isig -icanon -echo </dev/pts/3' 
  (with the affected tty as stdin)
  
  This bug has plauged Bashish a long while, it has probably been unseen as
  no one has expected the programs to accept WINCH at startup.
  As long as the terminal is able to send WINCH this might affect
  applications, that means this bug could (and does) affect XTerm, aterm,
  wterm, rxvt-unicode, rxvt, gnome-terminal.
  Further discussion here (for 'joe'):

  I have not found this BUG on Solaris 10, might it be linux specific?
