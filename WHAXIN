Prompt macros
-------------
Prompt macros are used in the prompt to provide better readability and in
some cases give better compatibility among terminals (especially Mac OS X
Terminal.app and Linux console), and for prompts to work on zsh, bash and
ksh at the same time.

The macros are available in

$BASHISHDIR/data/lib/_bashish_prompt_shellvars
