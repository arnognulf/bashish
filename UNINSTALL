To remove bashish from your system, not only your homedir.
Download the same release as you installed.

First, verify the version:

$ bashish -v

then get the bashishdir from the bashish command
(replace /usr/local in this example with the path bashish outputs)

$ bashish --bashishdir
/usr/local/share/bashish

now you can either use autoconf to uninstall

$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
$ make uninstall

or manually remove the files (as root):
# rm -rf /usr/local/share/bashish
# rm -f /usr/local/bin/bashish
