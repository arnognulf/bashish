.SH DESCRIPTION 
.PP
Bashish is a theme enviroment for text terminals. It can change colors, font,
transparency and background image on a per-application basis. Additionally
Bashish supports prompt changing on common shells such as bash, zsh and tcsh.

The \fIbashish\fP command launches the terminal theme part of the \fBBashish theme enviroment\fP.

Without options, \fIbashish\fP (re)starts the terminal theme enviroment, this is used internally
by \fIbashishtheme\fP(1), but can also be used by the user to force a terminal update.

Normally, \fIbashish\fP is launched from the shell startup file.
On unsupported shells it may be used to launch the bashish enviroment.
