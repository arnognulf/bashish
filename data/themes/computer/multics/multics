## It is hard to excactly emulate the multics return prompt.
## multics did not have a line prompt as the input were given on a 
## FNP (front end network processor), line by line (not character by
## character as most today terminals do)
##
## Multics did have a return prompt though, the output of 'who' below (from
## Bernd):

# who

# Multics MR8.0, load 32.0/40.0; 32 users, 28 interactive, 2 daemons.
# Absentee users 2/3
# IO.SysDaemon
# Dumper.Daemon
# Roach.SysMaint
# <lots of output following>
# r 13:14 0.099 59
#
# As you can see, Multics prompted the end of a program with a line beginning
#  with "r" (for ready) followed by the actual time, the CPU time, the
# command
# took to execute and (if I remember correctly) the amount of main memory
# used

## in this theme, the prompt shows the current load and current total memory
## usage instead of command cpu time and amoint of main memory used.
## 

## stty speed 150/300 might be fun =)

## for the welcome message

THEME_COMMENT="\
Bernd Ulmann sent a very helpful description upon how the multics
prompt worked, thanks!

The Multics operating system is the predecessor of UNIX, and thus shares
many commands with UNIX.

Multics ran on large Honeywell / Bull mainframes, the user input was given
on a Honeywell FNP (Front end Network Processor).

The FNP collected all keyboard input (it did not send character by character as most terminal emulators today
does) and sent it to the Multics mainframe when the user pressed ENTER.
The return prompt of Multics is the one displayed in this theme.

It was a very technically advanced operating system and had a featureset far
larger that of UNIX, the multics specification was 3000 pages, over time some
features were found redunant, however some features, especially some
security features are rarely found on other OS'es, and thus neither on UNIX.

Multics (which predates the programming language C) was written in the language PL/I.

In 1999(?), Canada, the last Multics mainframe was shut down.
