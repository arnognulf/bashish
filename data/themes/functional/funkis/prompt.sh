# All escape charachters we don't want counted (we don't want any except for $), we put between
# ${EMBED} and ${UNEMBED}
# 1. Save cursor postion -- ${ESC}[s
# 2. Say that we only want to be able to scroll between first and second last line,
#    this will have the effect that the user$host:path is always on the bottom line -- ${ESC}[0;$((LINES-1))r
# 3. Go to the last line -- ${ESC}[$LINES;0H
# 4. Make the foreground colot black and the background light gray --${ESC}[30;47m 
# 5. Give info: user$host:path -- \u@\h:\w (even though this will make printable characters, we don't want
#    to count them as such since we won't _type_ anything on that line. We only want to count those characters
#    that are on the line we enter commands)
# 6. Erase to the end of the line. This will have the effect that the whole line will have light gray as
#    background color, not just the user$host:path characters -- ${ESC}[K
# 7. Reset the colors -- {ESC}[0;0m
# 8. Restore the cursor position we saved in step 1 -- ${ESC}[u
# 9. Umbed. After this we will count all characters. The only characters are "\$ ".
