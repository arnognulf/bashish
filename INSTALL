Prerequisites
=============

Bashish requires the following packages to run:

   * bash >=2.04

Additional packages are recommended but not required:

 - dialog (for a spiffy curses based theme chooser)
 - xwininfo (for X support)
 - xprop (for X support)

Various fonts (optional for some themes, most importantly the c64 theme):
 - Adore64.ttf from http://www.freakyfonts.de/zip/adore64.zip
 - amiga4ever.ttf from http://www.freakyfonts.de/zip/amiga4ever.zip

If you're using fontconfig (any recent Linux does), unzip the fonts and copy
them to "$HOME/.fonts/", then run fc-cache as follows:

 $ fc-cache "$HOME/.fonts"

and restart your terminal (if using gnome-terminal, you _must_ exit all
terminals and restart them).

Additional install procedure (if you got bashish from github)
=============================================================
If you got bashish from github, you need to install autoconf and automake
and run the following command to generate ./configure as specified below

 % ./autogen.sh

Simple install procedure (if you got bashish from the tar.gz-source)
====================================================================

 % ./configure
 % make                                   # Create bashish headers
 % make install                           # Install bashish

Local install procedure
=======================
To install bashish in your own home directory (typically as non-root),
type:

 % ./configure --prefix=$HOME
 % make					# Create bashish headers
 % make install				# Install bashish
